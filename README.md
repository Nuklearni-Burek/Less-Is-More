## Grid-based number game
This is a simple grid-based number game implemented in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI).
Players aim to achieve a target value by combining numbers within a limited number of moves.
### How to Play
1. The game generates a random grid of numbers with a target value and a limited number of moves.
2. Players click buttons in the grid:
Clicking combines the values of two buttons and updates the total.
Only buttons in the same row or column as the previously clicked button can be selected.
3. The game ends when:
The total matches the target value (win).
Moves are exhausted without reaching the target (lose).
